Adalytics Live
=================

This is a basic hit counter, based on the old-school method of tracking images.

It doesn't use cookies or follow users around the web.

But it does give you a very simple counter for which pages in your website are popular!

Steps:

* Remix this project
* Show the project
* Copy the HTML for the image
* Paste it onto websites you want to track
* Refresh the page to see page views.

```html
<img src="https://adalytics-live.glitch.me/counter.png?fallback=MY_WEBSITE&color=black" alt="" style="vertical-align: bottom;" aria-hidden="true">
```

The counter looks like this: ![counter](https://adalytics-live.glitch.me/counter.png?color=black&fallback=[Fallback]Adalytics%20Readme)
